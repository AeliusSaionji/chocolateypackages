Pwn Adventure 3: Pwnie Island is a limited-release, first-person, true open-world MMORPG set on a beautiful island where anything could happen. That's because this game is intentionally vulnerable to all kinds of silly hacks! Flying, endless cash, and more are all one client change or network proxy away. Are you ready for the mayhem?!

&gt; ...wait, what?

No, really! We are security professionals that want to help game designers understand how and why players are able to take advantage of design and programming flaws. By creating a game that is intentionally flawed, we can create an example for developers of what not to do. Our hackable components all live in their own sandbox, too (the net code and game logic are completely custom), so you won't have to hack the engine (Unreal 4) itself!

You see, Pwn Adventure 3 isn't about being a really fun MMORPG (although, we certainly hope it is!). It's about providing hacking challenges for Ghost in the Shellcode 2015 and educating video game developers. After the limited release of the game, we intend to provide write-ups and examples of the flaws present in the game. We hope you'll show off all of your awesome hacks, too!

&gt; I've never heard of this, neat!

This is the sixth year for the Ghost in the Shellcode CTF itself, and the second year for Pwn Adventure. You can find more more details on last year's Unity-based version over at ghostintheshellcode.com.
