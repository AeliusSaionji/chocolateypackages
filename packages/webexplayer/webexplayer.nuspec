    <description>
        If you receive an email with a link to a WebEx recording, just click on the link to watch it. There's no player required. Or if you've downloaded a file, get the WebEx Player below (file types are .ARF or .WRF) for your operating system.

        Sharing is easy. You can post a link anywhere and your visitors can view the WebEx. Want to edit? Download the file and convert it to .WMV and edit like any video.

        There are two types of WebEx recording files â€” .ARF and .WRF. Choose the right player for your recording.
