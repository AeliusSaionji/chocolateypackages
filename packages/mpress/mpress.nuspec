    <summary>MPRESS is a free, high-performance executable packer for PE32/PE32+/.NET/MAC-DARWIN executable formats!</summary>
    <description>
MPRESS makes programs and libraries smaller, and decrease start time when the application loaded from a slow removable media or from the network. It uses in-place decompression technique, which allows to decompress the executable without memory overhead or other drawbacks; it also protects programs against reverse engineering by non-professional hackers. Programs compressed with MPRESS run exactly as before, with no runtime performance penalties.
