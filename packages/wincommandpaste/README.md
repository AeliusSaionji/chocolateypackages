# Windows Command Paste
Paste into any Windows console (command line, PowerShell, and Console2) with CTRL+V!

You *could* set the edit mode of your console to allow right-click pasting. You *could* use the built-in key sequence: `ALT+Space, E, P`. Or you *could* install this package and get an AutoHotKey script that makes `CTRL+V` work in any console window!

Unfortunately, unless you're an administrator, running with UAC *off*, you won't be able to paste into Administrator consoles.
