    <description>KeePass is a free open source password manager, which helps you to manage your passwords in a secure way. You can put all your passwords in one database, which is locked with one master key or a key file. So you only have to remember one single master password or select the key file to unlock the whole database. The databases are encrypted using the best and most secure encryption algorithms currently known (AES and Twofish).</description>

    <releaseNotes>
v2.20

New Features:
* Header data in KDBX files is now authenticated (to prevent silent data corruption attacks; thanks to P. Gasti and K. B. Rasmussen).
* Added management of working directories (a separate working directory is remembered for each file dialog context; working directories are remembered relatively to KeePass.exe; the management can be deactivated by turning off the new option 'Remember working directories').
* Added option to cancel auto-type when the target window title changes.
* Added quick search box in the toolbar of the internal text editor.
* Files can now be attached to entries by using drag &amp; drop from Windows Explorer to the attachments list in the entry editing dialog.
* Added '-pw-stdin' command line option to make KeePass read the master password from the StdIn stream.
* Added placeholders to get parts of the entry URL: {URL:SCM}, {URL:HOST}, {URL:PORT}, {URL:PATH} and {URL:QUERY}.
* Added a 'Details' button in the plugin load failure message box (when clicked, detailed error information for developers is shown).
* Added warning icon left of the Windows user account option description in the master key creation dialog.
* Added support for more image file formats (e.g. when importing custom client icons).
* Added support for importing DesktopKnox 3.2 XML files.
* The generic CSV importer now guesses whether the option to ignore the first row should be enabled or not (the user of course can still specify it manually, too).
* Added support for exporting to KeePass 1.x CSV files.
* Added support for moving the PLGX cache to a different remote drive.
* The Spr engine is now extensible, i.e. plugins can provide additional transformations/placeholders.
* On Unix-like systems, KeePass now uses the 'xsel' utility for clipboard operations, if 'xsel' is installed (in order to work around Mono clipboard bugs).
* Added Mono workaround to set the WM_CLASS property.
* Added workaround for Mono splitter bug.
* The 'PrepMonoDev.sh' script now removes the serialization assembly generating post build event.
* TrlUtil: added support for importing PO files.

Improvements / Changes:
* Improved FTP file existence checking.
* High DPI UI improvements.
* The database is not marked as modified anymore when using in-place label editing to fake-edit a group's name (i.e. when the final new name is the same as the previous one).
* Password is not auto-repeated anymore when trying to unhide it fails due to the policy 'Unhide Passwords' being disabled.
* Improved menu accelerator and shortcut keys.
* Changed IO connection name display format.
* Improved browser detection on Mac OS X.
* Task dialog thread safety improvements.
* Added UI check during import for KPScript.
* Upgraded and improved installer (now uses Unicode, LZMA2 compression, ...).

Bugfixes:
* On Windows systems, new line sequences in text to be shown in a standard multiline text box are now converted to Windows format.
