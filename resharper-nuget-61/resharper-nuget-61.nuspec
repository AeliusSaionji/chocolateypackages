    <summary>Plugin for ReSharper to support NuGet references correctly.</summary>
    <description>ReSharper has a Context Action on undefined types that looks at assemblies referenced in other projects for that type. If it finds a match, it will add a reference to the assembly, and import the namespace, fixing up the undefined error.

However, ReSharper always adds the assembly as a file reference, even if the assembly is part of a NuGet package. This means NuGet's referencing is bypassed, and the packages.config file isn't updated, dependencies aren't installed, and things don't work when it's time to update the package.

This plugin makes ReSharper invoke NuGet when adding a reference to an assembly in a NuGet package.</description>
