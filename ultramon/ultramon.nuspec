    <releaseNotes>
v3.2.1
Fixed issues
* Window buttons don't get added to Firefox

v3.2.0
Changes
* Windows 2000 is no longer supported, 3.2.0 requires Windows XP SP2 or later, or Server 2003 SP1 or later.
* If you have configured compatibility settings for 16-bit applications, you'll need to recreate those settings. This is due to a change in how 16-bit applications are handled. Please note that your settings will apply to all 16-bit applications, this was the case previously as well, but the user interface allowed setting up different settings for different 16-bit applications.
* All binaries (executables and DLL files) are now digitally signed, previously only the setup file was signed.

Fixed issues
* Multiple entries for the same application shown in application mirroring mode for some applications, for example Windows Media Player and Excel
* Fatal error in WndExt.cpp at lines 386, 392 and 1894 when running multiple 16-bit applications
* Fatal error in ButtonRendererVistaComposited.cpp at line 119 when using the PlastiQ Aero theme
* Occasional crash of UltraMon.exe when starting 32-bit application on 64-bit Windows 7 if UltraMon window buttons are disabled
* LabVIEW 2011 not shown in list of running applications when configuring compatibility settings via UltraMon Options > Compatibility
* UltraMon display configuration menu options such as Display Settings and Set Primary don't get disabled if the display control panel is disabled via group policy
* Smart Taskbar: minimize task via click on task button doesn't behave the same way as on the main taskbar
* Smart Taskbar doesn't work correctly if the shell process registry entry isn't set or uses a partial path
* Fatal error in TaskBand.cpp at line 1136 when using Taskbar Shuffle or Taskix to reorder tasks on the UltraMon taskbar
* Visual Studio 2003 restores to blank window after minimizing via click on task button
* With the Smart Taskbar enabled, explorer.exe may hang when resuming from hibernation
* Fatal or runtime error in UltraMonTaskbar.exe when using Stardock theme
* Smart Taskbar doesn't work when using Aston Shell version 2.0.4 or RES Workspace Manager
* Fatal error in TaskBand.cpp at line 485
* Wallpaper manager (UltraMonDesktop.exe) may hang instead of showing an error message when trying to load a corrupted wallpaper profile
* If a monitor is ignored, it may not be possible to enable another monitor connected to the same video card
* UltraMon may only show two monitors instead of 3 on Windows 7 when using a docked laptop with 2 external monitors connected
* Saving icon positions doesn't work if DeskScapes from Stardock is installed
* Scripting: object browser and script editor Intellisense don't show new methods and properties added in version 2.7.0 of the UltraMon COM objects
* Scripting: MonCtl.RefreshMonitorLayout crashes on Windows 7 if called before the monitor collection has been created
* Scripting: setting the MonCtl.SelDisabled property has no effect, and documentation is wrong

Known issues
* Runtime error in Adobe Acrobat when moving maximized window if Acrobat was launched from CCH ProSystem Engagement. As a workaround, go to UltraMon Options > Compatibility, then configure settings for Adobe Acrobat and check the 'use alternative method to move maximized window' option
* Docking hints from Xceed Docking Windows library don't work if UltraMon window buttons are enabled for the application
